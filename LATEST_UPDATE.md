# Audio System Fixed!

I've repaired the audio system which was previously broken due to a missing function definition.

### Changes Applied:
1.  **Restored BGM Logic**: The background music generator is now correctly defined and moved outside the hook scope.
2.  **Startup Fix**: Clicking "INITIALIZE SYSTEM" now properly resumes the AudioContext, ensuring music starts immediately.
3.  **Click Sound**: Verified the crispy mechanical click sound is implemented.

Please reload the application to hear the changes!
